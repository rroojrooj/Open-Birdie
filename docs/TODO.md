# Open-Birdie — TODO

## 3D buildings — SHIPPED (2026-06-27), with one follow-up

Buildings were the missing **vertical** structure ("still looks like paint on a
paper" feedback). Now: OSM building footprints render as extruded 3D massing —
walls + a colored roof (`scene.js _addBuildings`, flag `RENDER_CONFIG.buildings`),
seated on the lowest ground under each footprint, casting shadows. The clubhouse
gets a hero (terracotta-roof) material. Chambers Bay shows 185 buildings incl. the
real "Chambers Bay Clubhouse". `buildings` is a non-fingerprinted scenery field
(like `elevation.patches`), so attaching it never invalidates an HD bundle.
Served via `courseGeometry()` (`server.js`).

- **Data path today:** `node tools/add-buildings.mjs data/courses/<slug>.json`
  fetches OSM buildings for a cached course and attaches `course.buildings`.
- **FOLLOW-UP — auto-fetch on first load:** `lib/course.js` `FEATURES` still skips
  buildings, so a *freshly fetched* course has none until the tool is run. Wire
  `way/relation["building"]` into the Overpass query + parse in `parseOsm`. **Care:**
  compute the projection origin from golf coords only (buildings must not shift it)
  and do **not** bump `CACHE_VERSION` (both would change `courseFingerprint` and
  break existing HD bundles). New courses get buildings; existing caches keep theirs.
- **Polish:** roofs are flat massing blocks. Pitched/hipped roofs (esp. the
  clubhouse) would read far more like real buildings. Optional: window strips,
  merge into fewer draw calls if 185+ meshes ever costs FPS.

## QL1 gate — RESOLVED (2026-06-27)

Built **Chambers Bay hole 9** at **1 m** (`tools/hd-course/manifests/chambers-bay-hole-09.json`,
48 m relief, 32 m tee→green drop). Verdict: **real 1 m USGS 3DEP lidar fixes the
"flat / ink-on-paper" terrain** — it was a *data* limit (Bandon's 3 m grid smoothing
features < 6 m), not a shader limit. Dramatic, legible 3D relief at the player camera.
→ **Phase-1 AI hero-course authoring is NOT needed for relief** (the data does it); keep
it gated/unbuilt per the plan. The compiler is now course-general (3 courses, 3 UTM
zones, latitudes 30–47°N).

## Discovered — HD-hole ↔ coarse-course color seam (overhead views)

From a high overhead angle the HD hole reads as a pale rectangular "relief-map tile" on
the green coarse course. **The geometry is already seamless** — measured boundary seam
≤ 0.5 m (the compiler's `coarseBaseHeight` edge-blend works; coarse grid carries the full
71.9 m relief at 5 m). The "tile" is purely **color/texture**: the real pale NAIP
fescue/sand orthophoto on the HD hole vs the default green turf on the coarse course
(Chambers Bay has **no macro aerial** → flat green coarse turf). At the player/ground
camera the seam nearly vanishes (reads like a natural fescue→green turf change), so this
is overhead-view polish, low gameplay impact.
- **Fix:** give the coarse course a macro aerial (NAIP at coarse res) so coarse turf
  color matches the HD orthophoto, and/or feather orthophoto→turf *color* (not height) at
  the HD rect edge. Mirrors the deferred Bandon "macro color edge-feathering" polish item.

## Deferred

### Vertical-exaggeration knob (render fidelity)
Parked 2026-06-26 from the Phase-0 fidelity work. The "looks flat / map glued onto a
smooth surface" feel at ground level is a **geometry** limit (the 3 m terrain grid),
not shading — the de-light and meso-normal shader levers barely move it. The one
Phase-0 lever that would help is vertical exaggeration, deferred because it's a
**gameplay-affecting decision**, not a quick tweak:

- Add `RENDER_CONFIG.verticalScale` (default **1.0 = no-op**, safe for the shipping
  launch-monitor product — changing real-course terrain scale is a regression).
- Scale heights by `vs` **in lockstep at every render point** or objects float/sink:
  - `public/render/hd-terrain.js` `gridGeometry` — `pos[k*3+1] = heights[k] * vs`
    (thread `vs` through `buildHdTerrain` / `buildCoarseTerrain`).
  - `public/render/scene.js` `hAt` — multiply the returned height (seats ball, pin,
    trees, water plane, shadows, aim line on the scaled surface).
  - `public/render/scene.js` `_addGreenPatches` — scale the green-mesh heights too
    (omitting this was flagged in review: greens would sink into a 1.2× world).
- **The tradeoff to decide:** physics stays unscaled (render-only) → the rendered
  slope is `vs`× steeper than the slope the ball actually rolls/breaks on. On a
  fidelity sim that's a real "visual lie" (a putt breaks on the true slope while the
  eye sees a steeper one; ~1.2× is around the just-noticeable threshold on greens).
  Three options: render-only knob; scale physics too (consistent but changes every
  course's gameplay/calibration); or scale everything *except* greens.
- Bandon's flatness is **data-bound** (2008 3DEP, no QL1 lidar), so exaggeration is
  its *only* relief tool. Courses with real 1 m lidar get genuine relief for free
  via the resolution-adaptive compiler (shipped 2026-06-26: `manifest.terrain.
  nativeSpacingM`/`maxPx`).
- Verify via the render-grade loop at 1.0 / 1.2 / 1.3 (before/after dune captures).
